## Description

**Jepeter** is my own lightweight reverse search engine with Python, OpenCV and an Autoencoder in Keras to find people with similar faces in an unlabeled image dataset that can be easily scaled. 

Face recognition performance is evaluated with the [LFW dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) which you can replace with your own custom dataset.

Detect, transform, and crop faces on input images, use the autoencoder to extract 128-dimensional representations, or embeddings, of faces from the aligned input images compare input embedding vectors to labeled embedding vectors in a database.
